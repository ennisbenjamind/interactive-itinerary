Description:

Interactive Itinerary is a React on Rails web app that allows users to collaborate on an upcoming trip itinerary. Users can invite their friends to add and store event and lodging details. The entered address coordinates are extracted by the Google Places API and then outputted by Mapbox on a user-friendly map with markers and details for every entry. Additionally, the app aggregates all of the trip's expenses and divides them equally amongst all attendees so they know how much to budget for their trip.

I love exploring and learning about new places and thus traveling with my friends is a favorite activity of mine. However, I noticed that the burden of planning usually falls on one person. Interactive Itinerary is a tool for friends to help each other plan a trip in a way that is organized, and ultimately facilitates a headache-free and enjoyable trip for all parties involved.
